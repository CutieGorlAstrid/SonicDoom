### *Sonic: Lock & Load* is a hyper-fast stylish action first-person shooter based on the Sonic the Hedgehog series of games and built on GZDoom.

It's heavily inspired by the high-speed platforming of Sonic Robo Blast 2, the heavily movement-based FPS gameplay of ULTRAKILL and the stylish action of Devil May Cry.

The current version of Sonic: Lock & Load is v1.4 "Horizons", part of Season 1: Chaos.

**Have any suggestions for or problems with the mod?** Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Sonic-LockandLoad/Sonic-LockandLoad/issues/new/choose), it'll probably be resolved soon if possible.

To play an unstable version of S:L&L, use `git clone` to clone it to your computer, and open the cloned repo with GZDoom, like you would with a WAD or PK3. You can update with `git pull`. **Unstable versions contain unfinished stuff, the latest demo is recommended.**

GitHub shows C# and C++ as Sonic: Lock & Load's main languages - these are in fact GZDoom's ZScript and ACS files, treated as C# and C++ by GitHub Linguist respectively, for syntax highlighting purposes.
