# Sonic: Lock & Load - Changelog

This changelog aims to provide a mostly accurate and verbose overview of all
changes made to Sonic: Lock & Load.

## v1.4.1 "Vibrant Horizons" (upcoming)

## v1.4 "Horizons" (2023-11-26)

## v1.3.3 "Crystal Resurgence"

## v1.3.2 "Revised Resurgence"

## v1.3.1 "Attested Resurgence"

## v1.3 "Resurgence"

## Where are versions v1.1 and v1.2?

**v1.1 and v1.2 were incorrectly named.** They have since been retroactively
changed to v1.0.1 and v1.0.2 to align with proper semantic versioning.

Officially, v1.3 is the next version after v1.0.2. I'm not changing it to v1.1
because that would offset all later versions, and I can't be asked to deal with
the headache that's going to bring.

## v1.0.1 "Amended Chaos"

## v1.0 "Chaos"

## v0.9 "Dark"
